## About me

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/){target="_blank"}. The primary goal of my research is to develop statistical methods and analytic tools to solve problems in the social sciences. I am particularly interested in latent variable measurement in multilevel settings, propensity score methods for causal inference, and moderated nonlinear factor analysis. I have applied these methods in empirical work, including exploring trends in disproportionate discipline of minority students in schools over time, and developing a psychometrically sound screener of children’s social, emotional, and behavioral functioning.
