This relies heavily on the MplusAutomation package in R. An example Mplus input file for part 1: data generation can be found here, while an example Mplus input file for part 2: data analysis can be found here. For the illustrative example, the doubly latent model can be estimated in both Mplus and R using this data.\n\nModerated nonlinear factor analysis for SEM\nHere is R code used for all steps of conducting moderated nonlinear factor analysis using example data.\n\nStatistical power for cluster randomized trials\nHere is R code used to conduct a Monte Carlo simulation of statistical power for cluster randomized controlled trials with clusters of varying size\n\n\n\n",

The primary goal of my research is to develop statistical methods and analytic tools to solve problems in the social sciences. I am particularly interested in latent variable measurement in multilevel settings, propensity score methods for causal inference, and moderated nonlinear factor analysis. I have applied these methods in empirical work, including exploring trends in disproportionate discipline of minority students in schools over time, and developing a psychometrically sound screener of children’s social, emotional, and behavioral functioning.\n            \n            \n            \n            Education\n            \n            Ph.D.   |   2021   |   University of Virginia\n            Educational Psychology – Research, Statistics and Evaluation\n            \n            \n            \n            B.S.   |   2016   |   Syracuse University\n            Psychology – Minors in Applied Statistics, Philosophy\n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n                \n              \n            \n              Joseph M.
